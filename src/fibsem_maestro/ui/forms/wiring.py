"""
Cross-field wiring: area-selector overlays and nested-union followers.

Both read values from other fields of the same form. They are collected while
the form is built and wired once the whole tree exists, because a source may
live in a branch built later. Field paths are resolved against the declaring
object's siblings first, then against the form's editors by dotted path, from
the innermost enclosing scope out to the root. The walk goes through
`FieldEditor.value_editor()` / `child_editors()` only, so any container editor
implementing those takes part.
