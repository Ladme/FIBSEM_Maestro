What a freshly built settings form would reject, for every action, and rules that would fail.

A live settings object is always valid for its model, so a fresh form shows an
error only where an editor cannot represent the live value: a choice field
whose value is not among the editor's choices (the editor then reads None),
and an area selector holding fewer areas than its minimum.
