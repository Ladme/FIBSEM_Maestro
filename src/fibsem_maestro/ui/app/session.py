    The workflow being edited: its actions, rules, directories and their persistence.

    This is the only code in `ui` that mutates `Workflow.actions`,
    `Workflow.propagations`, an action's name or directory, or writes the
    workflow's `state.yaml`, `microscope_settings.yaml` or an action's
    `settings.yaml`. Every command keeps these invariants and persists before
    it emits:

    - I1: action names are non-empty, unique ignoring case with spaces equal to
      underscores, and never "workflow".
    - I2: an action's directory is `workflow_dir / name.replace(" ", "_")`.
    - I3: rules follow renames; removing an action deletes the rules it is the
      parent of and drops it from every rule's dependents; a rule left without
      dependents stays.
    - I4: renaming retargets every link (action-selector field) holding the old name.
    - I5: after a move, the moved actions' slices are clamped between their neighbours.
    - I6: new actions start at the workflow's slice and are persisted at once.
    - I7: structure and rule changes write the workflow's `state.yaml`.
    - I8: persist first, then emit fine-grained signals, then `structure_changed`
      or `rules_changed`.
    - I9: the workflow's `Actions` list is mutated in place, never replaced by a copy.
    - I10: rules are edited in place, never replaced.
    - I11: other services never cache `workflow`; it is replaced by `new_workflow`.
