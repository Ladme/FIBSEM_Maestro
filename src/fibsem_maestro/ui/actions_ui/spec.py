"""
Per-action user interface: which tools an action's header shows and which extra
sections its panel holds.

Every action gets the default tools (Prepare, Edit, Apply, Test) and no extra
section unless an `ActionUiSpec` is registered for its registry key:

```python
ACTION_UI.add("segmentation", ActionUiSpec(tools=(*DEFAULT_TOOLS, preview_tool)))
```

Modules under `ui/actions_ui/` are imported with the package, so registering
at module level is enough.
