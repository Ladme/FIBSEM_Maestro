"""
The refocus action, which keeps the trial frames of step-mode autofocuses in focus.

During a step-mode autofocus run, each frame of the linked imaging is acquired
at a different trial value of the swept attribute, such as the stigmator. Before
each of these frames, the refocus runs its own short sweep, usually over the
working distance, under the same conditions as the upcoming frame. It then
passes the best value to the imaging. Each trial is therefore scored at its own
best focus.

    Refocuses the linked imaging's next frame while it is a step-mode trial frame.

    Runs on every slice on which a step-mode autofocus linked to the same
    imaging has a run in progress, and once more after the run ends, so that
    the first frame at the run's result is in focus too. It never refocuses an
    attribute the running autofocus sweeps itself.

    The refocus applies the imaging's upcoming properties (including the
    trial value), runs its own basic or line sweep to completion, and patches
    the best value into the imaging's properties. It stores no properties of
    its own: everything that sets the focus must come from the imaging.
    Its only acquisition settings are the mode's scanning area and `delta_x`.

    It works on the beam of the linked imaging. In the workflow it must run
    after the step-mode autofocus and before the imaging (wrapping around the
    end of the list), so that it sees the trial value the imaging will use.
